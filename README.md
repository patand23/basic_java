# Basic Java Overview
  - Covering the basic concepts in Java
    - Object Oriented Programming (OOP)   
    - Classes
    - Objects
    - Methods
    - Flow of execution

## Getting Started
  -Fork Repository
  
  -Create Project in IntelliJ using CSV
  
  -Within the Lamp.java file, we can see a simple example of a class, a variable and a couple methods
  
  -Within the MainRunner.java file, we can see how to create objects from classes, and how to call methods
  
## Abstraction

        Dog dog = new Dog();
        System.out.print("The dog");
        if (dogs_light.isOn) {
            dog.eat();
            dog.makeSound();
        } else {
            dog.sleep();
        }

## Flow of Execution
  - Execution starts with the main method
  - Statements are generally executed from top to bottom, unless otherwise specified (ie. entering a loop or accessing a method)
